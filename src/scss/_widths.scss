/**
 * Width classes typically used on the grid, but can be used anywhere
 * where a fractional width is needed.
 * The classnames contain fractions that describe by how width the component
 * should be.
 *
 * You can also assign what breakpoint this will begin at.
 * `one-half@sm-up` for example will set the component with a width of 50%
 * for screens larger than then `$screen-sm` breakpoint.
