# rwsmith-grid
Probably the most feature packed responsive grid system you've ever come across&hellip;

**Features**
* Fluid
* Infinitely nestable
* Based on fractions rather than columns yielding increased flexibility over
  traditional approach using 12 columns.
* Intuitive classnames based on a BEM methodology hybrid known as BEMIT
* Optional equal height grid items based on flexbox (IE10+)
* Optional vertical alignment of grid items (when are differing heights).
* Large, standard, small or zero gutters.
* Optional vertical gutters&mdash;which match the width of horizontal gutters.
* No clearfixing required, rows of items with uneven heights tile gracefully.
* Does not require a wrapping element like most other grid systems.
* Extremely lightweight, using Sass @if blocks you can include only the
  features that you require via the `Feature-toggle` list.
* Width, push and pull classes are not tied directly to the grid, and can be 
  reused anywhere in your project.
* Ability to reverse the order of grid-items.
* Ability to use any number of user-defined breakpoints with user defined
  namespaces.

This grid system is Heavily influenced by [@csswizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry])'s

The responsive suffix classes are also based on Harry's writing:
