# rwsmith-grid
A feature packed responsive grid system 

##Acknowledgments
This grid system is Heavily influenced by [https://twitter.com/csswizardry](@csswizardry)'s
grid system [https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry-grids(csswizardry-grids)]  
The responsive suffix classes are also based on Harry's writing:
